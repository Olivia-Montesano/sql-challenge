# sql-challenge
For this challenge, I created an ERD for the various tables I would be adding to my database in pgAdmin using QuickDBD. Once I created this, I took a screenshot, which is included in this repository.

From here, I used the ERD to model my schema in my database. I added all of the tables and imported the csv's IN pgAdmin. This schema.sql file is in the repository as well.

The various queries for the required analysis included joining tables, finding exact and fuzzy  matches on values, and using a count aggregate and group and order by functions. I saved this all into a queries.sql file and that is in the repository as well.
